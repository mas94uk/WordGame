A simple word game for young children

Click on the word which matches the picture. You can download it and host it yourself -- there are no dependencies, so it should work offline -- or play it [here](https://mas94uk.github.io/WordGame/)

The screen is kept deliberately clutter-free: nothing but the game. Better still, make your browser full screen (F11).

Written for our boy who is currently 3yrs7months and he enjoys it. If you get some enjoyment out of it, I'd be glad to hear.
